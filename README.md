# TeachWiseAI

## Overview  
We aim to develop an AI-powered course assistance web application that enhances the learning experience for students while reducing the workload for instructors. By leveraging AI, the platform provides students with real-time, intelligent responses to course-related queries. It also supports instructors by managing courses, enrolling students, and facilitating interactions with course materials.

Built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** with real-time update capabilities, the platform ensures a seamless and responsive user experience. Our goal is to offer immediate support for students and valuable insights for instructors, ultimately contributing to a more effective and engaging educational environment.
